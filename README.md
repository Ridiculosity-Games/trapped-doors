# trapped-doors
A module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop that adds functionality to doors:
  * Allows the GM to attach traps to doors (with some included for dnd5e, add your own traps to the td-traps compendium in-game to expand it!)
  * Adds a keybinding for the GM to quickly arm/disarm trapped doors
  * Allows the GM to generate a key that will allow players to lock/unlock doors when in their inventory
